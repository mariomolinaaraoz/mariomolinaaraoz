I'm a Frontend Developer living in Tokyo, Japan, born and raised in Hawaii. My tech stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Redux, and Firebase. I am currently learning about UX/UI Design with Figma and I am also attempting to build out my own backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. When I'm not developing and building things, I enjoy writing blog articles, photography, basketball, and playing with my French Bulldog.
